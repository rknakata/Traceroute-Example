1. Describe in your own words how your traceroute program works. What did you try that didn’t
work? And, how did you address those issues?



2. Perform a traceroute to all the locations from the previous part of the lab and organize them by
total hop-distance (i.e., the number of intermediary routers). Are there any hosts that you can’t
reach? Of those that you can reach, graph the RTT versus hops: Does there seem to be any
correlation?



3. In this part of the lab, we used ICMP ECHO REQUEST to perform the traceroute; however, other
protocols are perfectly capable of being used for this purpose. Add in the option for your
traceroute program to use UDP packets and TCP packets for a traceroute. Note, that this is a
non-trivial extension. Speak with me if you’d like to attempt this.



4. Review the command line options for the real traceroute program. Add in options for -f and -m.
Rerun the experiments to traceroute to the destinations listed in Part 1 of this lab, do these
settings help reach the destinations?
